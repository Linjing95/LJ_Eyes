% Velocity-based saccade detection

% set.blink.extend: the time window extended before and after the blink (in
% ms)

% 3. velocity algorithm by Mathot (2013) - incomplete

% 4. noise-based algorithm by Hershman et al. (2018)

%% Data cleaning options

% 0: all artifacts
% 1: blinks

% 3. gaze data outside of the screen boundary
% 4. extreme velocity and acceleration of the gaze
% 5. extreme size of the pupil
% 6. extreme velocity of the pupil

%% Interpolation (for pupil data)
set.interp.method = 1; 
% 1: linear interpolation
% 2: spine interpolation

set.interp.range = 50; % Interpolation based on how many ms samples prior and after

%% Baseline correction (for pupil data)
set.bcorr.msg = 2; % choose the period between the 2nd and the 3rd message as the baseline period
% In this scenario, it is the fixation period

% choose the method of baseline correction
set.bcorr.method = 1; % 1, substractive; 2, divisive

% choose how to calculate the baseline pupil value, by taking either mean
% or median of the baseline period throughout the task
